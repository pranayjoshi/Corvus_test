This is small guide to make this work

To make this process as quick as possible I would like to use some hard coded values for path. Sorry for that.

if you want to keep everything simple just change the path value at `CodeGenerationTool.cs/Program.cs` at line 10. Just change the path to your current `stf`(i.e parent folder) directory.

This should perform the job
